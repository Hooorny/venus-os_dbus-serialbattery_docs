# How to connect and prepare the battery/BMS

> Make sure the data connection from the GX device to the BMS is isolated, see also [galvanic isolation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galvanic_isolation).
> Otherwise you can damage your GX device and BMS, since the negative current will flow through the data cable, if the BMS disconnects the negative pole.

Since for some BMS the port labeling is a mess and not reflecting the real situation here are some useful instructions and links.

## How to correctly daisy chain

RS485 is a differential balanced line over twisted pair, capable of spanning up to a few hundred meters. Be aware of voltage drops due to cable resistance and sensor power consumption.

Connect the wires in a point-to-point (daisy chain) configuration:

- **Avoid star or ring networks** to prevent signal reflections.
- The main cable runs from the master (USB to RS485 adapter) to all BMS and contains three wires:
  - **A (DATA-)**
  - **B (DATA+)**
  - **GND (common)** for proper reference

The main cable should be shielded. Ideally, the shield is separate from the 0 Volt line (GND), but they can be combined if the shield is free of voltage fluctuations.

Use a termination resistor (120-130 Î©) between A (DATA-) and B (DATA+) if the line is longer than 10 meters.

## Daly BMS

Connect your BMS via the PC software ([BmsMonitor](https://www.dalybms.com/download-pc-software/)) and set the `Sleep time(S)` to `65535` to prevent the BMS from going to sleep.

If you are using multiple batteries you also have to make sure, that the `Battery code` is different on every battery.

> ðŸŒ¼ðŸ”— Only if you want to connect multiple Daly BMS to the same RS485 adapter ðŸ‘‡

1. Use Daly's [BmsMonitor](https://www.dalybms.com/download-pc-software/) software (only for Windows) to set the board number.
  Using the mobile app `SMART BMS` to set the board number will not correctly set it.

2. Set a different board number for each BMS in the `BMS Tools` software and then specify the MODBUS addresses in the `config.ini` at the `MODBUS_ADDRESSES` parameter.

  For example, if you are using three batteries the parameter would be `MODBUS_ADDRESSES = 0x40, 0x41, 0x42`.

  | Board number | MODBUS address |
  | :---:        | :---:          |
  | `0`          | `0x40`         |
  | `1`          | `0x41`         |
  | `2`          | `0x42`         |
  | `3`          | `0x43`         |
  | `4`          | `0x44`         |
  | `5`          | `0x45`         |
  | `6`          | `0x46`         |
  | `7`          | `0x47`         |
  | `8`          | `0x48`         |
  | `9`          | `0x49`         |
  | `10`         | `0x4a`         |
  | `11`         | `0x4b`         |
  | `12`         | `0x4c`         |
  | `13`         | `0x4d`         |
  | `14`         | `0x4e`         |
  | `15`         | `0x4f`         |

## Daren 485

See [daren-485](https://github.com/cpttinkering/daren-485) on GitHub.

## EG4 LiFePower

Also valid for:

### |- Revov

### |- TianPower

Set your DIP switch pins to 1 for the battery connected to the Cerbo GX.

> ðŸŒ¼ðŸ”— Only if you want to connect multiple EG4 LiFePower to the same RS485 adapter ðŸ‘‡

Set different battery addresses for each battery using the dip switches and then specify the MODBUS addresses in the `config.ini` at the `MODBUS_ADDRESSES` parameter.

For example, if you are using three batteries (battery 1 dip switches: `1: ON, rest off`, battery 2 dip switches: `1: OFF, 2: ON, rest off`, battery 3 dip switches: `1: ON, 2: ON, rest off`) the parameter would be `MODBUS_ADDRESSES = 0x01, 0x02, 0x03`.

| Dip switch position | MODBUS address |
| :---:               | :---:          |
| `1 2 3 4`           |                |
| `_ _ _ _`           | `0x00`         |
| `â€¾ _ _ _`           | `0x01`         |
| `_ â€¾ _ _`           | `0x02`         |
| `â€¾ â€¾ _ _`           | `0x03`         |
| `_ _ â€¾ _`           | `0x04`         |
| `â€¾ _ â€¾ _`           | `0x05`         |
| `_ â€¾ â€¾ _`           | `0x06`         |
| `â€¾ â€¾ â€¾ _`           | `0x07`         |
| `_ _ _ â€¾`           | `0x08`         |
| `â€¾ _ _ â€¾`           | `0x09`         |
| `_ â€¾ _ â€¾`           | `0x0A`         |
| `â€¾ â€¾ _ â€¾`           | `0x0B`         |
| `_ _ â€¾ â€¾`           | `0x0C`         |
| `â€¾ _ â€¾ â€¾`           | `0x0D`         |
| `_ â€¾ â€¾ â€¾`           | `0x0E`         |
| `â€¾ â€¾ â€¾ â€¾`           | `0x0F`         |

## JKBMS PB Model (also know as JK Inverter BMS)

> ðŸŒ¼ðŸ”— Only if you want to connect multiple JKBMS PB BMS to the same RS485 adapter ðŸ‘‡

1. Give each battery a unique address using the jumper on the front. Do not use `_ _ _ _`, which corresponds to address `0x00`,
  as it sets the BMS into master mode, disabling RS485 communication. Then specify the MODBUS addresses in the `config.ini` at
  the `MODBUS_ADDRESSES` parameter.

  For example, if you are using three batteries (battery 1 dip switches: `1: ON, rest off`, battery 2 dip switches: `1: OFF, 2: ON, rest off`, battery 3 dip switches: `1: ON, 2: ON, rest off`) the parameter would be `MODBUS_ADDRESSES = 0x01, 0x02, 0x03`.

  | Dip switch position | MODBUS address |
  | :---:               | :---:          |
  | `1 2 3 4`           |                |
  | `_ _ _ _`           | `0x00`         |
  | `â€¾ _ _ _`           | `0x01`         |
  | `_ â€¾ _ _`           | `0x02`         |
  | `â€¾ â€¾ _ _`           | `0x03`         |
  | `_ _ â€¾ _`           | `0x04`         |
  | `â€¾ _ â€¾ _`           | `0x05`         |
  | `_ â€¾ â€¾ _`           | `0x06`         |
  | `â€¾ â€¾ â€¾ _`           | `0x07`         |
  | `_ _ _ â€¾`           | `0x08`         |
  | `â€¾ _ _ â€¾`           | `0x09`         |
  | `_ â€¾ _ â€¾`           | `0x0A`         |
  | `â€¾ â€¾ _ â€¾`           | `0x0B`         |
  | `_ _ â€¾ â€¾`           | `0x0C`         |
  | `â€¾ _ â€¾ â€¾`           | `0x0D`         |
  | `_ â€¾ â€¾ â€¾`           | `0x0E`         |
  | `â€¾ â€¾ â€¾ â€¾`           | `0x0F`         |

2. Use a ethernet/CAT cable to connect all batteries via the RS485-2 ports. Both RS485-2 ports can be used.

3. Connect the first battery to your Cerbo/Raspberry using the RS485 to USB cable that came with the BMS.

4. In the JKBMS App ensure that the UART Protocol is set to the default `0/1`.

5. Reboot the system to apply the changes.

1. Connect all batteries to the RS485 battery monitor or the BT2 to give the batteries individual addresses.

2. Disconnect the batteries from the RS485 battery monitor or the BT2 and connect them to the USB to RS485 adapter which is connected to the GX device.

3. Specify the MODBUS addresses in the `config.ini` at the `MODBUS_ADDRESSES` parameter.

  For example, if you are using three batteries the parameter would be `MODBUS_ADDRESSES = 0x30, 0x31, 0x32`.

  | Battery count | MODBUS address |
  | :---:         | :---:          |
  | `1`           | `0x30`         |
  | `2`           | `0x31`         |
  | `3`           | `0x32`         |
  | `4`           | `0x33`         |
  | `5`           | `0x34`         |
  | `6`           | `0x35`         |
  | `7`           | `0x36`         |
  | `8`           | `0x37`         |
  | `9`           | `0x38`         |
  | `10`          | `0x39`         |
  | `11`          | `0x3a`         |
  | `12`          | `0x3b`         |
  | `13`          | `0x3c`         |
  | `14`          | `0x3d`         |
  | `15`          | `0x3e`         |
  | `16`          | `0x3f`         |
